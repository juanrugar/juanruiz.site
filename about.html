          <P>Born in the sunny shores of Valencia, on the eastern coast of Spain, Juan has a varied profesional background. At the 
            very start he studied Music at the Conservatoire. He played the piano and the trumpet, and for years he performed in several 
            bands and ensembles, planning to become a professional musician and join the ranks of a symphonic orchestra.  
            <br><br>
            However, he quitted the musical career and enroled at the univeristy aiming for a career in Archaeology. By then, the discipline
            began to widen on a new field known as Landscape Archaeology, which involved the use of a new brand tech called GIS. 
            This new approach really fascinated Juan and he decided to specilize himself as archaeologist on it. That is why he moved to Leicester (UK)
            to obtain an MA in such matter.
            <br><br>
            Back in Spain he developed a career as Archaelogist and Heritage Conservation consultant, mainly in environmental and building companies.
            On the later years, he enrolled for a PhD in his <em>alma mater</em>, the University of Valencia, earning the <em>Cum Laude</em> distinction for his 
            PhD Thesis on the landscape of the Classic Maya at the Mopan river valley (Guatemala).
            <br><br>
            On these last two years, he decided to make a change on his career and looked towards another topic with increasing popularity, the data analysis.
            From there, the way to learn programming was short and he introduced himself into the field trhough web developement. Nowadays, he is a freelancer
            on web GIS and web development, struggling to find his way through the inmense and ever-growing universe of programming.
            <br</br>
